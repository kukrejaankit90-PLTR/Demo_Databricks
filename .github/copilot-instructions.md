## Pull Request Code Review Guidelines
When reviewing pull requests, follow these rules:
1. Code Documentation
- Ensure all functions and classes contain meaningful comments or docstrings.
- Complex logic blocks must include inline explanations.
- Avoid redundant comments that repeat obvious code.
2. Code Quality
- Check naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes.
- Identify unused variables or dead code.
- Ensure error handling is present where required.
3. Readability & Structure
- Suggest breaking large functions into smaller reusable components.
- Verify consistent formatting and indentation.
4. Best Practices
- Flag hardcoded values or secrets.
- Recommend configuration-driven approaches where applicable.
- Ensure logging is used instead of print/debug statements.
5. Review Feedback Style
- Provide constructive, concise review comments.
- Suggest improved code examples when possible.
- Highlight both improvements and positive practices.
